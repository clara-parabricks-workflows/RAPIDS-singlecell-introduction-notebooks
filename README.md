# **RAPIDS-singlecell Tutorial Notebooks**


---



This repository houses the notebooks made to run on [RAPIDS-singlecell](https://rapids-singlecell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a GPU accelerated library developed by [scverse®](https://github.com/scverse).
The goal is of this repository is to help users be able to try out and explore many different capabilities of RAPIDS-singlecell on cell datasets ranging from **250 thousand to 11 million cells** on their own CUDA capabile GPU systems or on an instance of the quick deploy capability of [Brev.dev](https://developer.nvidia.com/brev) Launchables.

These notebooks will be valuable for single-cell scientists who want to quickly evaluate ease of use as well as explore the biological interpretability of RAPIDS-singlecell results. Secondarily, scientists will find value in learning to apply these methods to very large data sets. This repository is also broadly useful for any data scientist or developer who wants to run and evaluate single cell methods leveraging RAPIDS-singlecell. Data sets used for this tutorial are were made [publicly available by 10X](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets) as well as [CZ cellxgene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/).

If you like these notebooks and this GPU accelerated capability, and want to support scverse's efforts, please [learn more about them here](https://scverse.org/about/) as well as [consider joining their community](https://scverse.org/join/).

# Overview

For those who are new to doing basic analysis for single cell data, the end to end analysis of [01_demo_gpu_e2e](01_demo_gpu_e2e.ipynb) is the best place to start, where you are walked through the steps of data preprocessing, cleanup, visualization, and investigation.

## Deploy on a CUDA compatible GPU system

### 1. System Requirements
All provisioned systems need to be RAPIDS capable. Here's what is required:

<i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> **GPU:** NVIDIA Volta™ or higher with [compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 7.0+
- For most of the notebooks, we recommend a **GPU with 24 GB VRAM or more**, due to the dataset size, such as the **L40S**, which can be quickly deployed here.  Some other common GPU options found in your workstations or favorite cloud service providers are:
  - A/H/B100
  - GH200
  - L40s
  - A10
  - A5000 or better
  - A4000 ADA or better
  - 5090
  - 4090
  - 3090

The [multi_gpu_large_data_showcase](multi_gpu_large_data_showcase.ipynb) and the [demo_gpu-seuratv3-brain-1M](demo_gpu-seuratv3-brain-1M.ipynb) requires a large multigpu system.  The [out-of-core_processing](out-of-core_processing.ipynb) notebook, even using the 11 million cell dataset, and the [demo_gpu-seuratv3](demo_gpu-seuratv3.ipynb) are respectively similar and can be run on one of the GPUs above, but a 48GB GPU is recommended.

# Detailed Overview of the Notebooks


---


### **Notebook 01_demo_gpu_e2e : Basic Demo Workflow**

By the completion of this notebook, a user will be able to do the following:

- Load and Preprocess the data
    - Load a sparse matrix in h5ad format using Scanpy
    - Preprocess the data, implementing standard QC metrics to assess cell and gene quality per cell, as well as per gen

- QC cells visually to understand the data
    - Users will learn how to visually inspect 5 different plots that help reflect quality control metrics for single cell data to:
        - Identify stressed or dying cells undergoing apoptosis
        - Empty droplets or dead cells
        - Cells with abnormal gene counts
        - Low quality or overly dominant cells

- Filter unusual cells
    - Users will learn how to remove cells with an extreme number of genes expressed
    - Users will filter out cells with an unusual amount of mitochondrial content

- Remove unwanted sources of variation
    - Select most variable genes to better inform analysis and increase computational efficiency
    - Regress out additional technical variation that we observed in the visual plots (Note, this can actually remove biologically relevant information, and would need to be carefully considered with a more complex data set)
    - Standardize by using a z-score transformation

- Cluster and visualize data
    - Implement PCA to reduce computational complexity. We use the GPU-accelerated PCA implementation from cuML, which significantly speeds up computation compared to CPU-based methods.
    - Identify batch effects visually by generating a UMAP plot with graph-based clustering

- Batch Correction and analysis
    - Remove assay-specific batch effects using Harmony
    - Re-compute the k-nearest neighbors graph and visualize using the UMAP.
    - Perform graph-based clustering
    - Visualize using other methods (tSNE)

- Explore the biological information from the data
    - Differential expression analysis: Identifying marker genes for cell types
        - Implement logistic regression
        - Rank genes that distinguish cell types
    - Trajectory analysis
        - Implement a diffusion map to understand the progress of cell types

### **Notebook 02_decoupler - Decoupler-GPU: Accelerated Transcriptional Regulatory Analysis**

This is an overview of methods that can be used to investigate transcriptional regulation. Although the tutorial does not dive deeply into these models, the notebook is used to reflect a difference in speed that is benefitted by GPU.

### **Notebook demo_gpu_e2e_with_PR - A different way to normalize with Pearson Residuals**

By the completion of this notebook, a user will be able to remove unwanted sources of variation using Pearson Residuals to normalize. This is a different approach to analysis from Notebook 01. After filtering, we introduce a normalization step toa address the potential issues in how we previously removed unwanted sources of variation.

### **Notebook spatial_autocorr - Visualizing and investigating spatial transcriptomics data**

By the completion of this notebook, a user will be able to do the following:
- Compute spatial autocorrelation, which represents how gene expression levels are spatially distributed across tissue sections.
- Use Squidpy to compute a graph on the coordinates
- Compute two metrics using Moran's I (better for global structures) and Geary's C (better for local structures)
- Explore the results visually by plotting the expression of genes Mbp (myelin-associated) and Nrgn (neuronal marker)

### **Notebook out-of-core_processing - Scale analysis to 11M cells easily and quickly leveraging Dask**

By the completion of this notebook, a user will be able to do the following:
- Create a local DASK cluster
- Load data directly into an AnnData object using a Dask array
- Filter cells and genes without additional computation
- Log normalize the data and identify highly variable genes
- Scale gene expression
- Compute PCA using GPU acceleration

### **Notebook multi_gpu_large_data_showcase - Multi-GPU showcase using persist**

By the completion of this notebook, a user will be able to perform the same steps as Notebook 05, but with the following:
- Process massive single-cell datasets without exceeding memory limits
- Fully utilize all available GPUs, scaling performance across multiple devices
- Enable chunk-based execution, efficiently managing memory by loading only necessary data

### **Notebook demo_gpu-seuratv3 - End to end example on Brain Cells**

By the completion of this noteobok, a user will be able to perform similar steps to Notebook 01 (end to end demo) but on brain cells.

### **Notebook demo_gpu-seuratv3-brain-1M - End to end example on 1M Brain Cells**

By the completion of this noteobok, a user will be able to perform similar steps to demo_gpu-seuratv3 but on 1M brain cells.
